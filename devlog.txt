Things Done: fixed errors with level & game board
   -in Level, one of the methods had a return type of level instead of Level
   -in Board, add method needed another case for if right branch smaller than left. also, made calls to non-existent methods getChild & setChild, replaced with calls to methods to get/set the appropriate child (left if adding to left branch & vice versa)
