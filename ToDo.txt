Mochventures To Do List!

So because we are in different periods, and can't work together in person in class, I thought it would be a good idea to keep a checklist of things to do, so we each know what we have to get done. 

Also feel free to edit and change anything you want, I'm still not 100% about how our project is going to develop and these are supa loose guidelines I guess
