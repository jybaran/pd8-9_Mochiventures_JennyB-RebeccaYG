How to play:
First, select a name for your character.
As you travel through Japan, you will find mochi & special items, and may sometimes encounter enemies called tanuki. When you run into a tanuki, you will have the choice to give it some of your mochi to make it go away, run, or answer its question, which will be a piece of Japanese trivia. If you run, you might get away safely, but you might get caught & lose some mochi and some of your health. If you choose to answer the question, answering correctly will earn you some mochi, but an incorrect answer will also result in health & mochi lost. Good luck!
At the end of each level, you can choose one of two places to move on to. Donâ€™t worry, you will eventually visit all of the locations, but the order you choose affects the way the game develops.
