Gion
The sun filters in through the perfectly kept trees and dapples the bridges in front of you. You stare awestruck as a geisha shuffles by; she is flawless. Her face is smooth and white, with ruby red lips and jet black hair. You wonder how someone so perfect could exist in the same universe you inhabit. She disappears down an alleyway, the only thing left to remember her by is the swish of her kimono.
