Honenin Temple
You step inside and a universal calm falls over you. The moss and the trees and the streams all seem to be breathing. You get the sense that each stone on the path was carefully placed, that each brick has its purpose and reason. You slip off your shoes and the smooth wood feels warm against your socks. The only thing you hear is the rustle of the leaves and the trickle of water. This is peace.
