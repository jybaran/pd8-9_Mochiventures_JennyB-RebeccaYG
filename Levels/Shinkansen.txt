Shinkansen
You look out the window, and feel your stomach drop as you see towns and houses and mountains fly by at 200 miles an hour. You focus on the seat in front you, and try not to think about how fast you're moving. The trolley with bento and onigiri rattles by. If you close your eyes you can just manage to pretend that you're on stable ground.
