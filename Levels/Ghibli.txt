The Studio Ghibli Museum
Everything is light and airy and wonderful. You climb through the spiral staircase, ducking to fit through the exit, and wonder why you ever grew up. The cat-bus awaits you, if only you were younger than 12. For now, you can live in a world of dust-mites and broomsticks and magic.
