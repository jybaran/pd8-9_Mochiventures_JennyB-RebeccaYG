Harajuku
You are on a bustling street. There are sales-people shouting things at you in a language you do not understand, but you don't mind. You like the movement and the sounds and the smells. To your right is a small boutique that sells Lolita-style dresses. Upstairs in the same building is a store that advertises punk rock paraphernalia. Its windows are painted black. To your left is a candy store with lollipops the size of a small child's head. This is the center of youth and fashion and creativity.
