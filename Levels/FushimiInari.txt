Fushimi Inari Shrine
You are walking up a path on the side of a mountain. Surrounding you on three sides are bright orange torii (tradition Japanese gates). Painted on each torii are names. Some are larger than others, they are not all the same shade of orange. They shelter you as you make your way up the mountain, each step muffled by the pitter-patter of soft rain.
